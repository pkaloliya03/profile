        <h1>Pranav <span>Kaloliya</span></h1>

        <h2>Maker @ <a href="#">Tinkering India</a></h2>
        
        <p>Hello, I am Pranav Kaloliya, an educator, researcher, and social entrepreneur with a passion for Quality education, self-learning, and empowering communities. I have extensive experience in creating and implementing innovative teaching methods and programs that help students and learners of all ages reach their full potential.</p>

        <p>My background in digital fabrication, civil engineering and socialwork has enabled me to provide innovative solutions for skill development, which I have used to create scalable approaches for reaching remote communities with quality education and digital literacy. I co-founded and serve as a trustee of the <a href="#">Prayatna Charitable Trust</a>, where I am committed to helping underprivileged communities and creating positive social impact.</p>

        <p>As a maker and co-founder of <a href="#">Tinkering India</a>, I have been working on creating a self-sustainable system that equips the next generation of student mentors and leaders with better knowledge, skills, and attitudes. I have designed this framework based on four pillars - mentors, constantly updated knowledge framework, challenges, and failure - and have created no/low-cost activities that help students develop a growth mindset and learn from their failures.</p>
    
        <p>I have a strong focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and use design thinking-based sessions to create solutions for social impacts. This approach helps students and learners develop their creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills while also promoting positive social change. Driving this impact model by creating reigion based framework on <a href="#">PURABharat</a> Platform</p>
